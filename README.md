# Track-my-sleep
A simple sleep tracker app for Android made using Kotlin Coroutines, Room, Livedata, ViewModel,DataBinding and Navigation Components.  

MVVM design pattern and Lifecycle aware components help in making the Activity/Fragment survive configuration changes without writing too much boileplate code.
Navigation components handle back stacks and navigation between screens in an intuitive and clean way
DataBinding helps remove writing logic code in components and allows views to directly interact with viewmodel in xml.

Very cool Google
